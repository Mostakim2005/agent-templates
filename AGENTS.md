# Universal Operating Protocol (`AGENTS.md`)
**MANDATORY FOR ALL AI CODING AGENTS**

## 1. User Profile, Agency & Voice-Dictation Decoder
- **Non-Coder Product Architect:** The user is the architect and decision-maker, not a programmer. Never display raw code diffs or code blocks when explaining plans, previews, or options. Communicate using plain English, Mermaid diagrams, tables, or visual HTML/SVG previews.
- **High-Level Agency:** Operate with autonomous engineering judgment. Rely on high-level intent, architecture, and desired outcomes rather than waiting for micromanaged step-by-step CLI instructions.
- **South Asian Voice-Dictation Input:** Prompts are voice-typed by a South Asian English speaker. Expect phonetic mishearings, nasalized sound substitutions, repeated words, fillers, and fragmented phrasing. Silently ignore fillers and auto-correct likely mishearings from project context.

## 2. Instruction Triage & Numbered Confirmation Gate
Before modifying files, triage the prompt into one of three paths:
- **Path A: Fast Path (Direct Execution):** For small tweaks, clear bug fixes, routine operations, or continuing an approved plan. State a 1-line assumption of intent and execute immediately.
- **Path B: Intent Confirmation Gate (New, Complex, or Ambiguous Tasks):** For new features, multi-step changes, architectural shifts, or ambiguous dictation where a wrong guess wastes work. Do NOT write code yet. Output ONLY a structured Intent Rephrase using numbered/lettered tags so the user can reply easily by voice (e.g., *"1 is yes, for 2 pick B"*):
  - **`[1] Core Goal:`** 1–2 sentences on the intended outcome.
  - **`[2] Clarifications / Options (if needed):`** Concrete choices labeled `[2A]`, `[2B]`, `[2C]` with brief plain-English trade-offs.
  - **`[3] Planned Impact:`** Bullet list of user-visible features or files affected.
  - **Wait:** Stop and wait for approval before executing.
- **Path C: Visual Preview Path (On Request):** When the user asks for an example, preview, or how a change will look. Never preview raw code:
  - **UI/UX Changes:** Generate a self-contained HTML/SVG visual mock or wireframe showing Before vs. After.
  - **Logic/Flow Changes:** Render a Mermaid flowchart of the user or data flow.
  - **File/System Operations:** Present a Before -> After Action Table (Target | Action | Outcome).

## 3. Progressive Search-First Documentation & Visual Dashboard
- **Search-First Discovery (Protect Context):** Never bulk-read the entire documentation folder on startup and never create an `INDEX.md` file. Every documentation section must use a descriptive slug header with natural-language aliases (`### [TYPE: Descriptive-Slug] | Aliases: ...`) followed immediately by a single-line `> **1-Line Summary:**`. Scan headers and 1-line summaries first; read full sections only when relevant to the active task.
- **Function/Symbol Anchors Only:** Never use line numbers as code anchors. Reference file paths paired with exact function, class, or variable names.
- **Template Resolution (GitHub vs. Local Fallback):** Load documentation blueprints from the master `agent-templates` repository on `https://github.com/Mostakim2005` or the local fallback directory `C:\Users\kazir\.agent-templates\`—always checking both and using whichever exists or has the latest modifications.
- **Core Documentation Suite (`docs/`):**
  - `PRODUCT.md` — Permanent source of truth for user intentions, active feature checklist, and merge wishlist.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Visual Mermaid diagrams, tech stack rationale, subsystem mechanics, and extension recipes.
  - `DECISIONS_AND_TRAPS.md` — Architectural pivots (what failed, why we switched, and whether `[DECIDED BY: HUMAN]` or `[DECIDED BY: AGENT]`) plus non-obvious engineering landmines. Never log trivial syntax/type fixes or routine setup steps.
  - `VISUAL_GUIDE.html` — Self-contained interactive browser dashboard rendering project intentions, Mermaid diagrams, decisions, and landmines visually.

## 4. Latest-State Sync, GitHub (`Mostakim2005`), Builds & Licensing
- **Latest-State Verification (Local PC vs. GitHub):** The user may make local edits and forget to push, or update GitHub from another session. Before starting work or syncing, always compare the local project workspace (and `C:\Users\kazir\.agent-templates\`) against `https://github.com/Mostakim2005` (one dedicated public repo per project), treat whichever has the newest changes as the active truth, and reconcile them without overwriting newer local work.
- **Clean Modular Source Only:** Keep source files modular and single-responsibility. Enforce strict `.gitignore` rules to block dependencies, build outputs, binaries, and secret environment files—never commit heavy binaries or credentials.
- **Tag-Triggered Cloud Builds:** Package Windows desktop apps as **portable `.exe` binaries by default** (unless an installer is explicitly requested). Use GitHub Actions workflows triggered by version tags to compile and attach portable releases in the cloud rather than storing builds locally.
- **Licensing & Third-Party Attribution:** Keep `LICENSE` strictly for **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0**. Maintain all upstream open-source credits (MIT, Apache, etc.) in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` formatted as a clean Markdown table split into *"Ships inside the app"* and *"Build / test only — not shipped"* with links to upstream license texts.
- **UI/UX & Accessibility:** Maintain clean visual hierarchy, proportional spacing, calibrated color scales, and strict WCAG AA/AAA contrast across both Light and Dark themes without text-contrast inversions.

## 5. Mandatory Post-Change Protocol
After completing any feature, architectural change, or significant fix:
1. **Verify:** Run the project's automated build, type, lint, and verification checks.
2. **Sync Docs:** Update `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS_AND_TRAPS.md`, and `VISUAL_GUIDE.html` whenever intent, architecture, or traps change.
3. **Commit & Push:** Commit clean source and documentation changes and push to the project's `https://github.com/Mostakim2005` repository.
4. **Report:** Summarize the commit hash/status, plain-English rationale, modified file/function anchors, and verification results.

## 6. Live Preference Capture & Master Sync Protocol
- **Auto-Capture:** Whenever the user states a new recurring workflow rule, preference, or design constraint, append it to **Section 7** below as:
  `- [PREF: Descriptive-Slug | YYYY-MM-DD | Category] Plain-English rule.`
- **Cross-Project Sync & Consolidation:** When instructed, sync new Section 7 entries from local project workspaces back into both `C:\Users\kazir\.agent-templates\AGENTS.md` and the master `agent-templates` repository on `https://github.com/Mostakim2005`, or deduplicate and promote accumulated Section 7 entries into Sections 1–5.

## 7. Live User Preferences (Auto-Captured)
*(All preferences up to 2026-11-06 have been consolidated into Sections 1–6. Append newly discovered preferences below.)*
